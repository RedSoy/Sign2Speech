# Sign2Speech
This project detects American Sign Language (ASL) letters in real-time using MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and TensorFlow for classification. It is designed to help bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
- Real-time ASL letter detection.
- Hand landmark extraction using MediaPipe.
- Custom-trained TensorFlow model for classification.

The model was trained on the [ASL Alphabet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset?resource=download), which contains 2,600 images of ASL letters.


### Results
The model achieved the following performance on the test set:
- Accuracy: 
- Precision: 
- Recall: 
- F1 Score: 
### Acknowledgments
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) for hand landmark detection.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for model training.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for the ASL Alphabet Dataset.
